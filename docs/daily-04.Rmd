## Objectives:

- Fork a Git Repo
- Meet RMarkdown 
- See some basic data

## Your Assignment:

1. Read this document in both knit and raw Rmd format to review Rmarkdown syntax.
2. Change the author in the YML to your name
2. Modify the city threshold to 100,000 (no comma!!)
3. Re-knit the document
4. From the knit document, right click on the map image and save it to the img directory.
5. Push your changes back to your Github repo
6. Submit the URL to your repo and the saved map image to the Guachospace Dropbox.

## Data: USA Cites

Accessed 07/27/2020 from: https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities

# What is Rmarkdown:

R Markdown provides an unified authoring framework for data science, combining  code, results, and   commentary. R Markdown documents are fully reproducible and support dozens of output formats, like PDFs, Word files, slideshows, and more.

![](../img/rmarkdownflow.png)

It contains three important types of content:

1. An (optional) YAML header surrounded by ---s which defines the: 

 - Output type
 - theme
 - metadata (author/date/title. subtitle)
 
2. Text mixed with simple text formatting like # heading and _italics_.

3. Chunks of code surrounded by ```.

# How do I make this thing run?

Once, and only when, the document is saved ... Hit,

`Cmd/Ctrl + SHIFT + K`

or the `knit` button above.

# Where do I see the output?

The document will knit to the same directory as the Rmd in the format defined.

Click the settings (wheel) icon next to `knit` to render the output document in a new window (Preview in Window) or in the RStudio Viewer Pane
(Preview in Viewer Pane)

# Header 1 (H1)
## Header 2 (H2)
### Header 2 (H3)
#### Header 4 (H4)
##### Header 5 (H5)

- a bulletpointed
- list of 
- things

1. Or a 
2. numbered list
3. of things
    a. Maybe with some nested sections
    b. like this
4. Then something else...

I can make something **bold** with double asterisks, or *italicized* with single asterisks. 

Make something superscripted^UP^ or subscripted~DOWN~

I can add a regular hyperlink by just writing the URL: https://github.com/mikejohnson51/spds

Or I can have [linked text](https://github.com/mikejohnson51/spds).

I can add an image: 

![](../img/globe-image.jpg)

And I can refine the image: 

![](../img/globe-image.jpg){width="50%"}

I can also add document breaks:

# Code 

These are teasers for where we are going. If the code doesn't yet make sense that is expected!

Focus on what we are doing with Rmarkdown... the exposure to this code and workflow will help when we get to discussing them next week.

All code is run is code snippets. Code snippets can be auto generated with:

`Cmd/Ctrl + Alt + I`

or by clicking "insert"

The following table summarizes which types of output each option **suppresses**:

|       Option      	| Run code 	| Show code 	| Output 	| Plots 	| Messages 	| Warnings 	|
|:-----------------:	|:--------:	|:---------:	|:------:	|:-----:	|:--------:	|:--------:	|
| eval = FALSE      	| X        	|           	| X      	| X     	| X        	| X        	|
| include = FALSE   	|          	| X         	| X      	| X     	| X        	| X        	|
| echo = FALSE      	|          	| X         	|        	|       	|          	|          	|
| results = "hide"  	|          	|           	| X      	|       	|          	|          	|
| fig.show = "hide" 	|          	|           	|        	| X     	|          	|          	|
| message = FALSE   	|          	|           	|        	|       	| X        	|          	|
| warning = FALSE   	|          	|           	|        	|       	|          	| X        	|


# Inline code:

Read in our data:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# load tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

# read in city data
cities = readr::read_csv('../data/uscities.csv')
```

# Exploration

Here we see some basic data exploration tools to see what our data looks like:

```{r, eval = TRUE}
names(cities)
head(cities)
summary(cities)
str(cities)
dim(cities)
```

# Some basic Data Exploration

Which an understanding of the data, lets answers a few questions:

```{r}
# Which cities are the most dense?
cities %>%
  select(city, state_id, population, density) %>%
  arrange(-density) %>%
  head()

# Which cities have the most people?
cities %>%
  select(city, state_id, population, density) %>%
  arrange(-population) %>%
  head()
```

## In line code:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
threshold = 1000000
big_cities = 
  filter(cities, population > threshold) %>%
  filter(!state_name %in% c("Alaska", "Hawaii", "Puerto Rico"))
```

We can evaluate R variables and code in-line:

For example, there are `r nrow(big_cities)` cities with a population greater then `r formatC(threshold, format="d", big.mark=",")`.

Here is a map!

```{r, echo = FALSE}
big_cities %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  aes(x = lng, y = lat) + 
  geom_point(aes(size = population, color = density)) + 
  scale_color_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red") + 
  labs(title = "USA Cities Population Stats",
       subtitle = paste("Cities bigger then:", 
                        formatC(threshold, format="d", big.mark=","),
                        "people"),
       caption = paste("Made by:", rmarkdown::metadata$author, "- Geography 176A"),
       x="",
       y = "") + 
  theme_bw()
```
